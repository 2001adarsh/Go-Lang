BEST PRACTICES:

1. Don't create goroutines in libraries (if not using channels)
    - Let consumer control concurrency.
2. When creating a goroutines, know how it will end.
    - Avoid subtle memory leaks.
3. Check for race condition at compile time.
    -  go run -race .\Goroutines\goroutine.go : command to check race by GO.
